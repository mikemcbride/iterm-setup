## iTerm2 Setup

Setting up and syncing terminal preferences is a pain. This makes it easier.

## Setting it up

- Clone the repo
- In iTerm, go to `Preferences > General`
- At the bottom left, check the box for `Load preferences from a custom folder or URL` and select the folder where you just cloned the repo
